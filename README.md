# WamBot.Twitch
A bot for my [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/wamwoowam)! Consists mostly of joke commands with a sprinking of useful things in there


## ⚠ WARNING ⚠
Because, frankly, it's funny, the code for this bot contains a large amount of strong language and adult themes. If you're a future employer judging me for writing this, I didn't want to work for you anyway.

It's also mostly been hacked together on stream, where a quick implementation means more than a fast or good one, this is not a good benchmark of skill.
